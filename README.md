## Description

 * Ideally, this repo shall contain top level folders for each of the major cloud providers viz. AWS, Azure and GCP.
 * Each cloud provider's folder viz. **aws-lamda** to have a README on any Prerequisites for that Provider.
 * Finally, there would be platform specific examples inside that provider's folder such as
   * aws-lambda/node
   * aws-lambda/python
   * Each of these platform folders will contain their own README with examples tying them up with Sentry!
